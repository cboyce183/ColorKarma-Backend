# ColorKarma-Backend

Simple Express with local storage for now, deployed on heroku.

Need to add:
- Database (SQLite or MongoDB)
- Redis cache when database is added.
- Accounts/ saving system. Possibly just token based temporary accounts saving palettes for up to a month, a sign up seems overkill
  for the scope.
  
If you want to contribute or have any suggestions or issues, contact me!
